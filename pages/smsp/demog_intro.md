## What are the Demographic requirements for a service consumer?

Built upon the foundation capabilities and the spine mini service capabilities, currently Demographics being the first capability provided direct by NHS Digital.

The consumer demographics requirements are defined within the PDS Client Requirements Document. An extract of the requirements can be found [here](demographics_reqs.html).
