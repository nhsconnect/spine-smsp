## What are the foundations for a service consumer?

The ITK Spine Mini Service Foundations are essentially a set of common requirements which will be applicable to all consumers. The diagram below shows how the set of Spine Mini Service Documentation has been organised and classified.

The consumer foundation requirements are defined within the ITK Common Client Requirements Document. An extract of the requirements can be found [here](foundations_reqs.html).


{% include important.html content="The full documentation set is published on the TRUD website. This site is intended as quick-start reference to enable developers to understand the scope of requirements for a consuming client." %}
